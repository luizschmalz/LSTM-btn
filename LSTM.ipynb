Também notamos que a partir de certo ponto, os valores começavam a oscilar durante o treinamento entre as epócas, não conseguimos eliminar isso mas reduzimos ao máximo prezando por uma razão entre desempenho e não repetição de valores no quantificamento das epócas. Com esse estudo conseguimos entender melhor como os hiperparametros funcionam para esse problema específico, e entendemos que existem infinitas possibilidades a serem exploradas afim de chegar num resultado cada vez melhor."
